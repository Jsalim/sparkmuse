    <h4>Let us know what you think</h4>
    <p>
      Sparkmuse is just beginning and we want to hear what you think, down to the smallest detail.
      We want to provide a place where you can begin researching, organizing, and iterating on your ideas early
      in the same way you would with its actual development.  We also want to foster a community where a wide variety
      of relevant help is just around the corner and meeting potential cofounders is charmingly simple.  If
      you would like to help shape our future, please chime in!
