    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>
      Hi! Thanks for stopping by to find out about Sparkmuse. We are a community of thinkers
      and doers focused on the early stages of creation- before cofounders, before product,
      and before users.
    </p>

    <h3>What's the Skinny?</h3>

    <p>
      Sparkmuse is a community focused on discussing, refining and acting on innovative tech
      ideas. We welcome any ideas which aim to solve an identifiable need through science,
      engineering, and technology. This includes web applications, mobile tech, robots, circuit
      boards, industrial design, or even the human genome. This is an environment for creativity
      and inspiration, a network for both you and your ideas to flourish and grow as your vision
      matures. Here is what we offer you:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A community of fellow entrepreneurs to get feedback on your ideas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skillsets spanning the diverse range of needs for a startup.  These are people you
        can network with to get help.
      </li>
      <li>
        An environment where creative ideas are allowed to intermingle, providing opportunities
        for new ones to be inspired.
      </li>
      <li>
        Partnerships with people and programs designed specifically to help you succeed. (More on this coming soon!)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Musing at a Glance</h3>

    <p>
      Each idea you post gets its own Spark page. You can think of this page as an idea wiki
      except that discussion is a first-class citizen. This page will allow you to track your
      progress, explain the problem you are trying to solve and your proposed solution, link to
      important resources, provide visuals of mockups or other diagrams, and most importantly
      get the feedback of our community. Sparks are also a connection point where anyone can
      offer their services and team-up on a project.
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, we encourage everyone to particapate in other peoples' ideas that catch
      their interest. Ideas cross-polinate when given several different points of view.
      Your contribution to other ideas will both improve that idea and possibly give you a
      thought for your own that wouldn't occur otherwise.
    </p>

    <h3>Sharing and Stealing</h3>

    <p>
      Sparkmuse is the beginning of a community in which I've always wanted to participate.
      "That's a cool idea" has crossed my mind so many times that I've yearned for a place to discuss,
      vet, and organize those thoughts. Over the years of reading Hacker News, there have often been
      "Rate My Idea" posts and some who outright said they wish they had a more formal place to share
      them. Sparkmuse will hopefully become that place.
    </p>

    <p>
      I know what that little voice inside your head is saying: with sharing comes the possibility of stealing.
      But who knows what the next big thing will be?
      Your ideas are fundamentally your own, made in your image.  Only you have the vision and only
      your execution will make it successful.  No imposter will ever be able to steal its core, just
      impersonate its facade.  So share, get your idea out in the wild as soon as possible and go to
      pivot town on it.  I promise it will be for the better.
