  title: Sparkmuse, an Application Idea Community
  stage: NEW
  problem: >
    There presently isn't a go-to site on the net for discussing new tech ideas.
    Whether they be web or mobile apps, B2B or B2C, or oriented towards social or
    gaming, you are left with two alternatives: real contacts or discussion boards
    lacking for the task. You can certainly get great value from real contacts,
    especially if you live in a booming hub, but you miss out on cross-polination
    as most meetups are among birds of a feather. An online discussion board can
    give you this insight, but their functionality doesn't invite brainstorming and
    collaboration after the initial discussion.
  solution: >
    <p>I want to create a community where techies can throw out their ideas and get
    quality feedback from a diverse community, find potential cofounders, brainstorm
    new directions, and track their progress.</p>
    <p>The technology solution isn't as difficult or interesting as will be forming the
    community itself. I've seen many requests per day for reviews and feedback in various
    places around the net and I think those are the best leads with which to start. For
    these people, I will both offer my insight to their request and then invite them to a
    more formal place for them to get more of it. I cannot think of a better way to form
    a community for idea discussion than to track down the people who most want it. I think
    they would be personally invested in participating and strengthening the site.</p>
